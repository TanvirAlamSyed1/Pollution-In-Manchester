# Pollution In Manchester
This was my first project in a team in University.
The aim was to spread awareness of the problems and solutions of of pollution within Manchester.
I was Project Manager, and was mainly focused on making sure we were able to hit deadlines and making sure the team were doing well as well as a finished outcome for the project.
You can see we have HTML, CSS and JS to make the fully functioning website.
This Project demonstrates:
- Interactive Websites
- Use of graphs and displaying data
- Clean GUI
- well presented website with good colour scheme
