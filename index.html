                This website has been created in order to inform the people of Manchester that pollution may change the way that we live, as well as future generations. According to Greater Manchester Annual Status Report statistics, <a href="https://cleanairgm.com/data-hub/monitoring-reports/">1110 people in Greater Manchester have die due to toxic air</a>.
                Many hidden statistics, which are included on this page, outline how crucial it is as Mancunians to take action to save out city as well as our world. We hope that this page educates you so that you to tackle this global problem!

            <h2>Types Of Pollution</h2>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Air Pollution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Air pollution is a huge issue in the world nowadays, from the increase of vehicles on the road to boom in industry more and more gases such as carbon monoxide are getting released into the atmosphere and causing harm. Carbon monoxide is
                    a product of burning fossil fuels and can be a problem in households when appliances like gas stoves and space heaters are left on. Another toxic element which is found in the air is lead which can be emitted by leaded aviation fuel
                    and industrial metal foundries and this can cause lead poisoning which effects the kidneys. Another example of a harmful gases which pollutes our atmosphere is nitrogen oxides which are products of burning fossil fuels and they react
                    in the atmosphere to form nitrogen dioxide which effects those with lung or heart conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Water Pollution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Water pollution refers to any pollutants in our rivers, lakes, and seas. An example of this is sewage which is released into rivers and causes eutrophication which causes algal blooms, and this has huge effects on the local ecosystem as
                    the algae block light and stops photosynthesis. Agricultural pollution can also seep into the waters as animal waste is treated the same as human waste and over time is washed away and get into the ground water. Animal waste is usually
                    stacked up into piles and often leak into the soil and ground water. Land pollution also can get into the water ways from littering. An example of this is when plastic is carried into the drains and once it reaches the drains it reaches
                    the sea and sea life then the plastic is consumed and turned into micro-plastics. After this when the fish are caught humans consume these micro-plastics and this can put you at risk of cancer.</p>
            </div>
            <button type="button" class="collapsible">Noise and Light Pollution</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Noise and light pollution are caused in urban environments by street lights and noise of vehicles mostly. Noise pollution in cities can contribute to hearing loss over time and studies have shown loud noise can contribute to high blood
                    pressure and stress which can lead to heart problems. Noise pollution effects marine life as well as sonar from ships create loud noises and dolphins and whales can get lost as they rely on sonar for navigation. Light pollution has
                    also been seen to cause health effects as it can cause impaired sleep and causes the circadian rhythm to be off, this has been linked to depression in certain studies.

            <h2>Pollution in Manchester</h2>
            <div id="information">
                Manchester finds a majority of its pollution coming from a few main sources, as well as its geographical and city-based terrain not being particularly conducive in allowing pollution to disperse properly. One of the main sources contributing to declines
                in air quality would be vehicular emissions, with exhaust fumes containing large amounts of noxious chemicals that can accumulate in areas of heavy traffic whereby they enter the air, often undergoing chemical reactions with other pollutants
                in the air to create a wider variety of atmospheric contamination. The number of cars, buses, trucks, and motorbikes that inhabit the road often give out large concentrations of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as well as sulphur
                dioxide (SO2), with sulphur dioxide being responsible for contributing to acid rain that causes a large amount of erosion damage to buildings around the city. Of note is that all this pollution is concentrated on the ground level, between
                vast buildings that act as a pollution trap. In times past, a majority of the pollution would have come from roofs and chimney stacks whereby it would still pollute the atmosphere, but have a less directly damaging effect on its inhabitants
                who have to navigate the streets below. Other sources would include modern industries, with a large number of factories still relying on fossil fuels (coal in particular) to provide their energy. The combustion of coal can lead to pollutants
                such as black carbon and volatile organic compounds (VOC's) entering the atmosphere, as well as being by-products of domestic heating, all causing the air quality index to rise. With Manchester being a city that experiences fairly cold
                temperatures during the winter months, a lot of energy used to heat homes would cause a rise in pollution levels, although on a finishing note, the most prominent out of all the sources of pollution seems to be the motor vehicle industry.

        <div id="waste">
            <h2>Waste in Manchester</h2>
            <div id="information">
                Waste is often an overlooked cause of rising greenhouse gas emissions - it accounted for 4 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2015. Its management is crucial for the health of our cities, its inhabitants and global sustainable development. Changing
                the way we produce and consume goods and resources can reduce our ecological footprint and lead us on the path towards a zero-carbon future. The release of methane and CO2 from poorly managed waste and landfills could be responsible for
                up to a tenth of manmade greenhouse gases in ten years' time. Open burning of waste is unfortunately also all too common. The abundance of plastic burned can also lead to some catastrophic health impacts and environmental degradation.
                We are all unfortunately aware of the damage plastic pollution is having on our oceans too. Food waste can be just as harmful as the plastic that often contains it when it comes to emitting emissions - if food waste was a country, it would
                be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter after China and the US. According to a study from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), between 30 and 40% of food produced globally is never eaten. Over production and consumption
                of meat products especially gives rise to increased GHG emissions, and this trend could spread over to emerging economies as they develop.<br /> Some of the key solutions for Greater Manchester include:
                <ul>
                    <li>How waste at the end of a tenancy in a rented accommodation must be dealt with by the landlord.</li>
                    <li>How sustainability should be embedded back into the primary school curriculum and community.</li>
                    <li>How individual waste policy in each GM council could in fact be tied together "monopoly style", so that consumers and household can be more informed, information gaps closed and services more efficient.</li>
                    <li>The engagement of students from the University of Manchester and MMU.</li>
                    <li>Annual litter picks along Corridor Manchester involving students, community groups and primary schools, to promote leading by example.</li>
                </ul><br /> Manchester can only become a world leading, green city region once waste management becomes recognized as a powerful driver of sustainable urban development. How citizens, councils and companies understand the GM rubbish crisis
                will determine our ability to work together and achieve a cleaner and greener Greater Manchester.

            </h2>
            <div id="information">
                <b>Solar panels</b> - Solar panels seem somewhat impractical in the UK where it rains most of the time. but it would be useful to make use of as many natural resources as possible. Buildings use about 40% of the world’s energy. Putting
                solar panels on the roofs and on the sides of many high-rise buildings would aid in renewable energy production to help power big co-operations in Manchester city centre.
                <br>
                <b>Spiral wind turbines</b> – Spiral wind turbines would be useful on top of tall and short buildings in the city centre. They are less dangerous than conventional wind turbines and far more efficient when capturing air. They can be easily
                inaugurated into buildings are less dangerous to birds.

                <br>
                <b>Synthetic Fuel</b> - Synthetic fuel from carbon capture and an ethanol fuel mix could replace fossil fuel at filling stations. These types of fuel burn cleaner and help cars run better, but they do cost a lot to make. CO2 extractors
                can be placed near the roadside and the gutters to condense and collect CO2 from cars
